In short, you should be excited by BlastOne if you are interested in a company that is
not only a major player in a niche but critical industry (corrosion control), but is also
actively innovating to make that industry more productive, safer, and more
environmentally friendly. They are a company that provides complete, engineered
solutions rather than just selling products, and their commitment to expertise and
customer support sets them apart.

Based on the information available, BlastOne provides a &quot;turnkey&quot; service for the
facilities used to maintain and repair these types of equipment, but they do not provide
the turnkey maintenance services themselves on a per-vehicle basis.
Here&#39;s a breakdown of what that means for fighter aircraft, warfighter ships, and space
launch vehicles:
* Fighter Aircraft and Warfighter Ships: BlastOne has a strong focus on the defense
and marine industries. They specialize in the design, engineering, and construction of
custom, large-scale blast and paint facilities. These facilities are &quot;turnkey&quot; in the sense
that BlastOne can handle the entire project from concept to completion, including:
* Facility Design: Creating custom layouts for blast and paint halls, including
ventilation, abrasive recycling, and humidity control systems.
* Construction and Integration: Building the physical structures and integrating their
advanced equipment, including robotic blasters and automated paint systems.
* Training and Support: Providing training for operators and offering long-term
maintenance and support for the equipment and facilities.
A key example is their work with General Dynamics on armored tanks. They designed
and installed a robotic blasting facility that dramatically increased productivity and
safety. This same model would apply to the large-scale, high-value components of
military aircraft and ships that require abrasive blasting and protective coatings. They
are a partner to the companies and government contractors that perform the
maintenance, not the direct maintenance provider.
* Space Launch Vehicles: While BlastOne&#39;s core business is in the heavy industrial and
defense sectors, their expertise in surface preparation and coatings is directly
applicable to the manufacturing and maintenance of space launch vehicles. The
components of these vehicles—from engines to fairings—require extremely precise and
durable coatings to withstand the rigors of launch. BlastOne would provide the same
type of turnkey facility solutions for companies like SpaceX, ULA, or other launch
service providers. They would not be launching the rockets themselves, but rather

BlastOne Research
providing the &quot;clean rooms&quot; and advanced surface preparation technology that is
essential to the manufacturing and refurbishment process.
In summary, you should not think of BlastOne as a company that will take a ship or
aircraft and &quot;turnkey&quot; it for you. Instead, think of them as the company that can provide
a &quot;turnkey&quot; solution for the facilities and equipment that will be used to maintain and
repair those assets. They provide the infrastructure and technology that allows defense
contractors and aerospace companies to do their job faster, safer, and cleaner.

After delivering a turnkey facility, BlastOne&#39;s business relationship with the receiving
company is designed to be a long-term partnership that fits an annuity model. Their
business isn&#39;t just about the initial project sale; it&#39;s about providing ongoing support and
revenue streams.
Long-Term Relationship &amp; Annuity Model
BlastOne fosters an annuity model through several key offerings:
* Consumables: They supply the high-performance abrasives, nozzles, hoses, and
other consumable parts that are essential for the daily operation of a blasting facility.
This creates a recurring revenue stream based on the customer&#39;s usage.
* Service Contracts: BlastOne offers preventative maintenance programs and service
contracts for the equipment they install. This ensures the facility runs at peak
performance, minimizes downtime, and extends the lifespan of the assets. These
contracts are a predictable, recurring source of revenue.
* Training and Certification: They provide training for new operators and maintenance
staff, which can be an ongoing need as companies experience employee turnover.
* Facility Modernization and Retrofits: As technology advances or a company&#39;s needs
change, BlastOne offers services to modernize and upgrade existing facilities. This
includes integrating new robotics, ventilation systems, or other productivity-enhancing
technologies.
This business model ensures that once a company invests in a BlastOne facility, they
remain a customer for the entire lifecycle of the equipment, creating a consistent and
predictable revenue stream for BlastOne. This is a classic annuity model where the
initial sale leads to a continuous, predictable flow of revenue from repeat business and
service contracts.
