research_task:
  description: >
    Conduct deep-dive research on {topic} (an industrial abrasive blasting and
    coatings company). Capture a current-state picture of the business and its
    data landscape. Focus on: company overview, products/services, customers and
    markets, operating model, value proposition, tech and automation signals,
    and especially data sources and flows across CRM, ERP, e-commerce, service,
    projects, finance, inventory, telemetry/IoT, and analytics. Identify key KPIs
    and decision points, pain points, risks/compliance concerns, and where data
    quality, accessibility, or timeliness limit value.
    The current year is 2024â€”ensure recency and cite sources when possible.
  expected_output: >
    A structured research brief with these sections:
    - Company overview and business model
    - Offerings and target markets
    - Operating model and key processes
    - Data systems inventory (source, owner, purpose, data domains)
    - Data flow narrative (from source to analytics/decisioning)
    - Core KPIs and where they originate
    - Pain points and gaps (with evidence)
    - Opportunities for value using data
    Provide concise bullet points under each section.

planning_task:
  description: >
    Transform research findings into a pragmatic 40-hour-per-month engagement
    plan to improve {topic}'s data capabilities. Prioritize highest-ROI work and
    define phases, milestones, deliverables, dependencies, risks, and success
    metrics. Include a time-allocation breakdown that fits 40 hours/month and a
    30-60-90 day roadmap with quick wins and foundations (data capture, ELT,
    modeling, dashboards, governance).
  expected_output: >
    A detailed plan containing:
    - Objectives and measurable outcomes (KPIs, SLAs)
    - Stakeholders and responsibilities
    - 30/60/90-day roadmap with milestones
    - Monthly 40-hour allocation by workstream (e.g., ingestion, modeling,
      analytics, governance, enablement) with hour estimates
    - Prioritized backlog with impact/effort rationale
    - Assumptions, dependencies, and risks with mitigations
    - Definition of done and acceptance criteria for each deliverable

reporting_task:
  description: >
    Produce a data strategy and investigation project proposal for {topic} that
    surfaces underlying data issues and lays out how to discover, validate, and
    resolve them. Convert research and planning into a stakeholder-ready plan
    including discovery tracks, pilots/POCs, measurement, and a 40-hour/month
    operating cadence. Emphasize business impact (revenue, margin, throughput,
    safety) with clear KPIs, governance checkpoints, and timelines.
  expected_output: >
    A proposal in markdown with sections:
    - Executive summary (problems, outcomes, and approach in one page)
    - Current state and gap analysis (systems, data domains, flows, pain points)
    - Investigation plan (hypotheses, discovery activities, interviews, data
      profiling, lineage mapping, access requests)
    - Pilots/POCs (each with objective, scope, success criteria, data needed,
      approach, timeline, and estimated hours)
    - Recommended architecture and tooling approach
    - Governance, quality, and security approach (controls, SLAs, ownership)
    - Roadmap and prioritized backlog (with impact/effort rationale)
    - 40-hour/month scope, timeline, and hour allocation
    - KPIs, SLAs, and measurement plan
    - Risks, assumptions, and next steps
